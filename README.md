# OptimalPowerSharing

A minimal starter repository implementing a simplified **loss-aware DC Optimal Power Flow (OPF)** model for small-scale / microgrid applications.

---

## Overview

This repository contains:

* `opf_complete.py` — a single-script implementation of a simplified OPF / optimal power sharing formulation
* `Ramharack_Loss_Aware_OPF_DC_Microgrids.pdf` — supporting technical manuscript
* `figures/` — supporting plots or visual outputs

The project is research-oriented and intended for experimentation and conceptual development.

---

## Scope

### This repository **is**:

* A prototype implementation
* A mathematical exploration of DC loss-aware OPF
* A foundation for further development

### This repository **is not**:

* A production-ready OPF solver
* A validated grid operations tool
* A packaged Python library with API guarantees
* A fully tested or benchmarked framework

---

## Status

Early-stage research code. Suitable for academic exploration and extension.
